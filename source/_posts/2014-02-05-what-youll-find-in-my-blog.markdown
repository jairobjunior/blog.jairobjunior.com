Hi guys, here is an overview of what you will find in [this blog][jb]. Basically, I will share [my experience][lk] as a software architect. There will be a big focus on mobile app development. I will also be posting about entrepreneurship and working remotely.

The [labs][lb] section has hacks to help you in your projects. You will hear a lot about [Ocypode][oc] and [Catfish][cf], they are open source projects that I created to colaborate with you on. Please check them out!
